## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability in the Retrack codebase, you can responsibly disclose it by sending a
summary to security@retrack.dev.
We will review the potential threat and work to fix it as quickly as possible.

Although we do not currently have a bug bounty program, we are extremely grateful to those who take the time to share
their findings with us.

Thank you!
